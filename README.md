# Jets Application

### Description
This project's focus have been a continuation of object oriented programming with an emphasis on building a parent and child classes and at least 2 interfaces.

For this project, I created an application with a fleet of jets with different capabilities.  It needed to have a menu that allowed users to interact with the jets created in an array list and access information about them.

I created three classes that extend from an abstract class, Jet: FighterJet, CargoPlane, and JetImpl. JetImpl is a generic jet which aligns with my Private Jets that I added in my text file, while FighterJet and CargoPlane implement the interfaces CombatReady and CargoCarrier, respectively.

**User Story #1**
Create a JetsApplication with a main method to launch your program.

**User Story #2**
Jets are found at an AirField. Create the AirField class, which has an empty List of Jets.

**User Story #3**
On program startup, populate the AirField with at least 5 Jets of different types.

These jets must be read from a text file, where each line in the file contains data for a single Jet object.

This file exists at the root of your Eclipse project. It can be comma- or tab-separated; either implementation is acceptable.
The method to parse a file into Jet objects should return a List<Jet>. Its parameter can be a String file name.
Remember to use String.split(regex) to break each line in the file into data to create an individual jet.
**User Story #4**
There is a menu with these options:

List fleet
Fly all jets
View fastest jet
View jet with longest range
Load all Cargo Jets
Dogfight!
Add a jet to Fleet
Remove a jet from Fleet
Quit
  
**User Story #5**
List fleet prints out the model, speed, range, and price of each jet. (There must be at least 5 jets stored when the program starts).

**User Story #6**
Fly all Jets calls the fly() method on the entire fleet of jets. fly() prints out the jet details and the amount of time the jet can fly until it runs out of fuel (based on speed and range).

**User Story #7**
The view fastest jet and longest range options both print out all of the information about a jet.

Note: these methods must search the collection of jets to find the appropriate jet.
  
**User Story #8**
The user is presented with an option specific to the interfaces you created. For example, Load all Cargo Jets, above, finds all implementors of the CargoCarrier interface and calls loadCargo() on each. (Note that the menu text is italicized because your options may be different, depending on your interfaces.)

**User Story #9**
A user can add custom jets to the fleet.

This can be a JetImpl.
Stretch Goal: This leads to a sub-menu where the user chooses the type of Jet.
Users then enter information for the Jet, and it is added to the AirField.

**User Story #10**
A user can remove a jet from the fleet.

The user is presented with a sub-menu to select a jet to delete by number.
Stretch Goal: a user can remove a jet (or jets) by name.
User Story #11
Quit exits the program.

### Lessons Learned
  
Each week has increased in difficulty.  Getting started and breaking down what I should be doing is a challenge; however, using a uml diagram and trying to articulate what I wanted to do with my code prior to acutally coding helped tremendously.  The largest difficulty initially was trying to determine how to get my buffered reader to read the Jets.txt file into my application.  With still finding getters and setters challenging, it was helpful to follow the prompts provided by Eclipse for suggestions as to pulling in each class' respective fields into the Jets Application. I had issues primarily with getting my menu to run. I switched from a while loop with if and else if statements to a switch and changed my criteria for the while loop and it worked.  At some point in the near future, I'd like to revisit this project and work on the stretch goals.
